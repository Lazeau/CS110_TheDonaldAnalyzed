>> DESCRIPTION
"The Donald Analyzed" is designed to use a set of data from
reddit.com/r/The_Donald in basic data science. With the data, this program
will explore several questions which can be answered by data analysis:
- Is there a correlation between post score and number of comments?
- What is the most popular post on /r/The_Donald? (By number of comments and upvotes)
- Are the majority of posts on /r/The_Donald supportive or critical of some topic?

The program uses several classes to find answers to the questions above. There are
comments throughout the code which explain how various functions operate.
